# Second 3d Model: Bottle
Now, I took on the challenge of modeling a bottle. 
This project helped me build on the skills I learned while creating the LEGO piece, 
as I had to work with more complex shapes and commands. Designing the bottle allowed me to explore new tools and techniques in Fusion 360, 
and it was exciting to see how I could bring a more intricate object to life. Each lesson feels like a step forward, and I'm looking forward 
to continuing my 3D modeling journey.

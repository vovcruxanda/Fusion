# First 3d model: LEGO

I recently began learning Fusion 360 by following a course on YouTube. 

As part of my first project, I modeled a LEGO piece. The experience has been both challenging and rewarding, as I get to practice my new skills while creating something familiar and iconic. Starting with a LEGO piece was a great way to dive into the basics of 3D modeling, and I'm excited to keep improving and tackling more complex designs!
